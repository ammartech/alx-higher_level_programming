# Python - Almost a circle

![Circle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/331/giphy.mp4)

In this project, I encapsulated skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the `unittest` module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Private attributes
* Getter/setter
* Class/static methods
* Inheritance
* File I/O
* `args`/`kwargs`
* JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
* Unittesting

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests/test_models](./tests/test_models): Folder containing the following independently-developed test files:
  * [test_base.py](./tests/test_models/test_base.py)
  * [test_rectangle.py](./tests/test_models/test_rectangle.py)
  * [test_square.py](./tests/test_models/test_square.py)
